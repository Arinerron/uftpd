uftpd -- Micro FTP daemon
=========================

Tired of confusing configuration files and security features you don't need?

          Try uftpd -- a no nonsense FTP server built just for you!

* uftpd has no configuration file
* uftpd listens to port ftp/tcp found in /etc/services, fallback to port 21
* uftpd serves files from the ftp user's home directory, fallback /srv/ftp
* uftpd can be run from inetd or as a standalone daemon

uftpd is based on [FtpServer](https://github.com/xu-wang11/FtpServer) by
[Xu Wang](mailto:wangxu.93@icloud.com).  This version, called uftpd, is
maintained by [Joachim Nilsson](mailto:troglobit@gmail.com) at GitHub
