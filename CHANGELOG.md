Change Log
==========

All notable changes to the project are documented in this file.


[1.7] - 2014-12-21
------------------

The TFTP Blocksize Negotiation release.

### Changes
* Support for [RFC 2348], TFTP blocksize negotiation
* Support for custom server directory, instead of FTP user's `$HOME`
* Log to `stderr` when running in foreground and debug is enabled


[1.6] - 2014-09-12
------------------

Fix missing [libuev] content generated by `make dist` in v1.4 and v1.5

### Fixes

* Since the introduction of the event library [libuev] the `make dist`
  target has failed to include the libuev sub-directory.  This is due to
  the `git archive` command unfortunately not supporting git sub-modules.
