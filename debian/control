Description: No nonsense TFTP/FTP server
 uftpd is a very simple TFTP and FTP server intended for small and local
 LANs.  It works on the Internet, although it is not recommended, and is
 set up in a read-only configuration by default.  It has no users, no
 configuration file, and is started on-demand by the UNIX inetd super
 server, neatly tcpwrapped for your safety.
 .
 Hardcore Internet users and anyone concerned about security should
 probably consider a separate TFTP server and for FTP look at one of:
 vsftpd, proftpd or pure-ftpd.
