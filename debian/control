Description: The no nonsense TFTP/FTP server.
 An excellent choice for those of us who never wanted to learn every
 config file format on this planet.  uftpd has no configuration, and
 starts automatically from the traditional UNIX inetd super server,
 neatly tcpwrapped for your safety.
 .
 Hardcore Internet users and anyone concerned about security should
 probably consider a seperate TFTP server and for FTP look at one of:
 vsftpd, proftpd or pure-ftpd.
