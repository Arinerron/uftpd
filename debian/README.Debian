uftpd for Debian
----------------

uftpd is a combined TFTP/FTP server perfectly suited for Intranets and
developer laptops.  It's however useless for Internet use, with security
considerations and multiple users as obvious gotchas.  It is however
really small, easy to setup, and just works right out of the box.
