uftpd for Debian
----------------

(May 4th, 2014)

uftpd is a very insecure FTP server.  It is also and totally useless for
multiple users.  It is however really small, easy to setup, and just works
right out of the box. 

The use-case is home users, developers or other's in already secured local
area networks.

Don't use it on the Internet.
